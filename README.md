# üîê Azure AD Authentication with MSAL and Microsoft Graph in Python

> üê≥ Fully containerized solution for secure Microsoft Graph integration

This project demonstrates Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication using the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) in a containerized Python console application. The app authenticates users, interacts with Microsoft Graph API to manage user data and calendar events.

## ‚ú® Features

1. üîë Secure device code authentication flow
2. üë§ User profile information retrieval
3. üìÖ Calendar management (view & create events)
4. üê≥ Docker containerization for easy deployment

Example output:

```plaintext
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code ABCD-EFGH to authenticate.

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone and Setup**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:

   > ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Step**: Create `.env` from template and add your Azure credentials!

   ```env
   CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-from-azure-portal
   TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id-from-azure-portal
   ```

3. **Run with Docker**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t azure-ad-auth-demo .
   docker run --rm -it --env-file .env azure-ad-auth-demo
   ```

## üìã Prerequisites

### Azure AD App Registration

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations
3. Click "New registration"
4. Set a name for your application
5. Select "Accounts in this organizational directory only"
6. Click Register

After registration:

1. Note down the following values (you'll need them later):

   - **Application (client) ID** - Found on the app registration Overview page
   - **Directory (tenant) ID** - Also found on the Overview page

2. Configure the app for public client flow:

   - Go to Authentication
   - Scroll to "Advanced settings"
   - Under "Allow public client flows", toggle to "Yes"
   - Add a Mobile and desktop redirect URI (e.g., <http://localhost>)
   - Save changes

3. Set API Permissions:
   - Go to "API permissions"
   - Add "Microsoft Graph" permissions:
     - User.Read (for profile access)
     - Calendars.ReadWrite (for viewing and creating calendar events)
   - Click "Grant admin consent"

### Environment Setup

1. In the root directory of the project, you'll find a `.env.template` file
2. Create a new file named `.env` in the same directory
3. Copy the contents from `.env.template` to `.env`
4. Fill in your values from the Azure AD app registration:

   ```env
   CLIENT_ID=your-application-client-id
   TENANT_ID=your-directory-tenant-id
   ```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The `.env` file is required for the application to work. Without proper credentials, the authentication will fail.

## Authentication Flow

1. When you run the app, it will display a device code
2. Open a browser and go to <https://microsoft.com/devicelogin>
3. Enter the provided code
4. Sign in with your Azure AD credentials
5. Return to the console app to see your profile and calendar information

## Project Structure

```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env              # Environment variables (git and docker ignored)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env.template     # Template for environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth_app.py       # Main application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile        # Container configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Documentation
```

## Microsoft Graph Features

The application demonstrates several Microsoft Graph API capabilities:

1. **User Profile Access**

   - Fetches user's display name and basic information
   - Uses Microsoft Graph `/me` endpoint

2. **Calendar Management**

   - Lists upcoming calendar events (up to 5)
   - Creates new calendar events automatically
   - Supports custom event duration
   - Uses Microsoft Graph `/me/events` endpoints

3. **Authentication**
   - Device code flow for headless authentication
   - Token management and caching
   - Secure scope handling

## Development Notes

- **Token Cache**: Located at `msal_token_cache.bin` (container-scoped)
- **Security**: Credentials passed as runtime parameters
- **Environment**: Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in your values
- **Dependencies**: Update `requirements.txt` and rebuild container as needed

## üîí Security Notes

- Environment variables are used for sensitive configuration
- Token cache is container-scoped
- The .env file is excluded from Docker builds
- Public client flow is secured by Azure AD's device code flow
